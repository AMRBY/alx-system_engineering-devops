### Issues are with this infrastructure ###

1) This architecture have no redundancy systems, it is essentially a flaw in the design of the system, circuit, and component, it poses a potential risk because it could lead to a situation in which just one malfunction or fault causes the whole system to stop working.

2) Downtime when maintenance needed becuase cannot redirect traffic to another system (redundacy)

3) The architecture dont have a load balancer to manage traffic so cannot scale if too much incoming traffic.
